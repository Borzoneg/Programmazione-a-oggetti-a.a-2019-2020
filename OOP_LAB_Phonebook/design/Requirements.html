<h1>Phone-book</h1><p>Design and implement a Java application to manage a phone-book containing contacts.
<h2>Requirement</h2>
<p>Each contact is identified by first name, last name, and phone number. <p>When the phone-book is created, it is given a name, which can be later retrieve through the <b>getName()</b> method.
<p>A new contact is added by means of the <b>add()</b> method, receiving three parameters: first name, last name, and phone number.
<p>The first contact of the phone book can be accessed through the <b>first()</b> method, returning a string representation of the contact, i.e., first name, last name, and phone number separated by a white spaces (e.g. <i>"John Smith 555 987643"</i>).<p>Each contact is identified by its position in the list, according to insertion order.  Therefore, contacts can be retrieved by means of the <b>get()</b> method, which accepts one parameter (the index of the required entry) and returns a textual representation of the entry (same format as previous method). Note that and indexes start at 1, i.e.,<i>first() == get(1)</i>.
<p>The whole phone-book can be converted to a string by means of <b>toString()</b> method. The resultingstring concatenates the textual representation of each contact, separated by commas. The whole list of contacts is delimited by parentheses.
<p>Finally, <b>find() </b>method returns the textual representation of first-found contact in the phone-book that contains the searched parameter in either first name, last name, or phone number.
